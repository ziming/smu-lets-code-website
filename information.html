            <p>In line with the government’s vision of a “smart nation” and the rising perceived importance of knowledge of programming, this project aims to introduce basic coding to year 1-2 Junior College (JC) and year 4-6 Integrated Program (IP) students who have not been formally trained in programming. The course will be conducted using blended learning pedagogy and features a mix of online learning and face-to-face tutorial sessions with teaching staff from the School of Information Systems (SIS) at the Singapore Management University (SMU). Participants will not be charged any fee for this program, although they should be committed to complete the entire course.</p>
            
            <h5>Objective</h5>
            <p>Introduce basic programming with a focus on problem solving to JC year 1-2 and IP year 4-6 students who have not previously taken a formal course in programming.</p>

            
            <h5>Eligibility and Pre-requisites</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>All current full-time JC students and year 4-6 IP students who are not taking “A”-level computing are eligible to apply. We welcome students doing all subject combinations (including non-science subjects). This course is NOT suitable for students who are already familiar with basic programming.</li>
              <li>Participants must bring their own laptop running Windows (any version), and have access to the Internet from home for the online teaching materials. (You may use a Mac running the MacOS, but you need to be familiar with using the terminal window for your own MacOS.)</li>
              <li>As part of the funding requirement, there is a pedagogical research element in this project. Participants will be asked to provide feedback about the pedagogical approaches adopted for this course. More information about this research will be sent to all applicants once the SMU Institutional Review Board has approved the research procedures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Participants who have completed the whole course are expected to be able to write and run code using the Ruby language to solve a range of programming problems. Participants will be familiar with variables, methods, loops, decision constructs and arrays, and be confident with their usage when writing a Ruby program.</li>
              <li>However, participants are not expected to be knowledgeable in the object-oriented (OO) aspects of programming. This course does not focus on OO concepts, comparisons between programming languages and algorithms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Certification</h5>

            <p>Participants will be required to take a hands-on and written theory exam on the last day of the course. Participants who pass the exam will be awarded a certificate of achievement from SIS SMU. Participants who have submitted all the required assignments by the final session, and met the attendance requirements (listed in “Schedule”) are eligible for the certificate.</p>

            <h5>Syllabus</h5>
            <p>The focus of this course is on problem solving. Hence enough fundamentals will be taught to let participants solve challenging problems. The topics to be covered are categorized into five units to be completed in order:</p>

              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Ruby will be the programming language used, and participants are expected to code using their preferred text editor (e.g. Notepad++). No particular IDE will be introduced, although participants are encouraged to use a proper IDE once they get proficient. Participants will be introduced to programming in both the interactive mode (using Interactive Ruby from command line) and “normal” mode (by running a .rb file from command line).</p>

            <p><a href="syllabus.html">Syllabus in detail</a></p>
            
            <h5>Schedule</h5>

            <p>Participants are expected to spend about three hours every day over three weeks, and be committed to complete the course on their own personal accord. Being a blended-learning course, participants are expected to watch video lectures online and complete assignments. The online materials are supplemented with regular meet-up (face-to-face) sessions and ad-hoc walk-in consultations. There are seven meet-up sessions of which five are tutorials. All participants must attend the briefing (first session) and exam (final session). All participants are strongly encouraged to attend all the tutorials, but must minimally attend at least two of the five tutorials in order to qualify for certification.</p>

            <p>Meet-up Sessions:</p>

            <p>(* SMU SIS: School of Information Systems. Exact classroom used will be decided later depending on class size. <a href="http://sis.smu.edu.sg/about/sis-contact" target="_blank">Info on how to get to the school here</a>)</p>

            <p>In between the face-to-face sessions, participants are expected to work from home and submit assignments for formative feedback. Submission of assignments is mandatory, and there will be one assignment for each of the five units. Participants may work at their own pace but need to adhere to assignment submission deadlines (because solutions will be discussed in videos after the deadline), and are encouraged not to fall behind the recommended schedule (as stated in the “syllabus” table). If necessary, participants are encouraged to contact teaching staff for virtual consultations (e.g. via Skype or phone) or walk-in consultations during office hours on non-meet-up days.</p>

            <h5>Registration and Withdrawal</h5>
            <p>Registration for the Dec 2016 intake will start in Aug 2016. Participants may withdraw from the course at any time by contacting the course coordinator.</p>

            <p>Legal liability waiver: By registering for this course, all registrants assume full responsibility for personal injury and release and discharge SMU for injury, loss or damage arising out of usage of, or presence at the facilities of SMU, whether caused by the fault of the registrants, SMU or other third parties.</p>
