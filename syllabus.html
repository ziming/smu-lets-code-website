                    <p>Unit 0 is delivered in workshop format during the first meet-up. It is expected to be completed during that session. Unit 5 is a “summary” unit that requires exposes students to more challenging and real-world problems that combine the knowledge gained from the various units. There is no lecture video/self-check quiz for unit 5, but there will be an assignment.</p>
